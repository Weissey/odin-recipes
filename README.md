Hello Weissey, this project will be for you to create a recipes website. This is not so focused on styling with CSS, but rather to familiarize yourself with core HTML principles. Reflection will be posted below after completion.

Reflection
    The initial learning curve of using the various html elements were time consuming, as I had to consciously pay attention to formatting and keystrokes. That changed very quickly as I began familiarizing myself, and I became more efficient over the project. The index page, and the first recipe page took a bit longer than the last two recipe pages. I also familiarized myself with image resizing since the home page frog chef was initially too big of an image. I incorporated <div> elements to better "contain" and organize my elements, specifically the <ul> and <ol> elements for easier formatting later with CSS. I also used IDs with <a> to create buttons for the user to return to the top of the page, and also an <a> link to return back to the main page.
